How to use it

Using make will create the libftprintf.a binary.

To include the library in your project, clone the repository in your working tree and compile with the following flags :

gcc -L. -lftprintf file.c
Available options

The function is called with the standard printf norm.

You can print strings with %s, or characters with %c. For decimal numbers, use %d or %i, or %u for unsigned. If you want another base, use %o for octal, %x for hexadecimal and %X for CAPS hexadecimal. Finally, %p displays a pointer address.

Width (%5s) and precision (%.5s) options are available, as well as width-flags - and 0 (%-5s or %05s), and work the same as printf.

Example :

ft_print("The number of %s is %d.", "people", 5);
>> The number of people is 5.

ft_printf("%d is %x in hex and %o in octal.", 30, 30, 30);
>> 30 is 1e in hex and 36 in octal.
